					Java Text Adventure Game
				</h3>
				<p>
					I made this during high school when I was in grade 11. It is a game where you play as a border inspection officer and analyze the immigration papers of people who want to enter the country. This project gave me an opportunity to learn and implement Object-Oriented programming principles.

					Text Adventure Game
				</h3>
				<p>
					I am currently making this during my first year of university. It is a game where you lead an ambulance crew and help patients as you travel across a post-disaster country. This project is allowing me to learn more about graphical user interfaces through the context of Python.
					<br><br>
					Due to plagarism policies at my university, I am unfortunately unable to provide source code for the project.
